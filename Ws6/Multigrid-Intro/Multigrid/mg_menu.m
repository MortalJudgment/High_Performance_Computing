function varargout = mg_menu(varargin)
% MG_MENU M-file for mg_menu.fig
%      MG_MENU, by itself, creates a new MG_MENU or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = MG_MENU returns the handle to a new MG_MENU or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      MG_MENU('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in MG_MENU.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      MG_MENU('Property','Value',...) creates a new MG_MENU or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before mg_menu_OpeningFunction gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to mg_menu_OpeningFcn via varargin.

%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
